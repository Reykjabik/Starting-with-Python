# Starting-with-Python
This is just intended to be an initial compilation of first scripts while travelling the Python road.

Hey! My name is Javier, a Spaniard relocated to Moscow, RU in search of a new life. 

My background is half computers, half linguistics. I studied CS more than a decade ago, and after a few years I dropped and changed to Linguistics, which is my current major. During the last years, I've been in and out coding, trying the Front End path for some months, and dropping again. 

2 years have passed since then, and here I am again, feeling the magnetism of coding knocking again. This time, oriented towards Data Science and Machine Learning. Whether I'll finally take this road till the end or not, I cannot say. What I can say is that these last months of studying this field have been pretty fun, and so I feel good about starting this. However it ends.

Ignition!
